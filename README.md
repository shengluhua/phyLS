# powerful heightened yielded Logic Synthesis (phyLS)

phyLS is based on the [mockturtle](https://github.com/lsils/mockturtle) and the [abc](https://github.com/berkeley-abc/abc), it can optimize different logics attributes. 
Currently, it supports mockturtle format(AIG, MIG, XAG, XMG) and abc format(AIG,GIA) based optimization.
